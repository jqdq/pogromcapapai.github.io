  abstract = {Goal reasoning (GR) has a bright future as a foundation for the research and development of intelligent agents. GR is the study of agents that can deliberate on and self-select their goals/objectives, which is a desirable capability for some applications of deliberative autonomy. While studied in diverse AI sub-communities for multiple applications, our group has focused on how GR can play a key role for controlling autonomous systems. Thus, its importance is rapidly growing and it merits increased attention, particularly from the perspective of research on AI safety. In this article, I introduce GR, briefly relate it to other AI topics, summarize some of our group's work on GR foundations and emerging applications, and describe some current and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Significance             There are currently more than 100,000 patients on the waiting list in the United States for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. To address this shortage, kidney exchange programs allow patients with living incompatible donors to exchange donors through cycles and chains initiated by altruistic nondirected donors. To determine which exchanges will take place, kidney exchange programs use algorithms for maximizing the number of transplants under constraints about the size of feasible exchanges. This problem is NP-hard, and algorithms previously used were unable to optimize when chains could be long. We developed two algorithms that use integer programming to solve this problem, one of which is inspired by the traveling salesman, that together can find optimal solutions in practice.           ,              As of May 2014 there were more than 100,000 patients on the waiting list for a kidney transplant from a deceased donor. Although the preferred treatment is a kidney transplant, every year there are fewer donors than new patients, so the wait for a transplant continues to grow. To address this shortage, kidney paired donation (KPD) programs allow patients with living but biologically incompatible donors to exchange donors through cycles or chains initiated by altruistic (nondirected) donors, thereby increasing the supply of kidneys in the system. In many KPD programs a centralized algorithm determines which exchanges will take place to maximize the total number of transplants performed. This optimization problem has proven challenging both in theory, because it is NP-hard, and in practice, because the algorithms previously used were unable to optimally search over all long chains. We give two new algorithms that use integer programming to optimally solve this problem, one of which is inspired by the techniques used to solve the traveling salesman problem. These algorithms provide the tools needed to find optimal solutions in practice.},

  abstract = {Genetic Programming (GP) is one of the evolutionary computation (EC) methods followed with great interest by many researchers. When GP first appeared, it has become a popular computational intelligence method because of its successful applications and its potentials to find effective solutions for difficult practical problems of many different disciplines. With the use of GP in a wide variety of areas, numerous variants of GP methods have emerged to provide more effective solutions for computation problems of diverse application fields. Therefore, GP has a very rich literature that is progressively growing. Many GP software tools developed along with process of GP algorithms. There is a need for an inclusive survey of GP literature from the beginning to today of GP in order to reveal the role of GP in the computational intelligence field. This survey study aims to provide an overview of the growing GP literature in a systematic way. The researchers, who need to implement GP methods, can gain insight of potentials in GP methods, their essential drawbacks and prevalent superiorities. Accordingly, taxonomy of GP methods is given by a systematic review of popular GP methods. In this manner, GP methods are analyzed according to two main categories, which consider the discrepancies in their program (chromosome) representation styles and their methodologies. Besides, GP applications in diverse problems are summarized. This literature survey is especially useful for new researchers to gain the required broad perspective before implementing a GP method in their problems.},

  abstract = {One of the major problems that both the developed and under-developed countries are facing is the difficulties of treating illhealth people. There is shortage of medical expertise in various hospitals, most of these countries are spending affluence of their resources to meet this challenge but still they are unable to meet the demands of providing good medical services for their people. It has become of great concern to find a lasting solution to the problem of traditional method of medical diagnostic which is characterized by inaccuracy and imprecision. Many researchers have developed several algorithms and technologies (including Fuzzy Logic, Genetic Algorithms and even Artificial Neural Network) to ensure accuracy and precision in the field of medicine which are branches of Artificial Intelligence. This paper covers the development of a medical diagnostic system using fuzzy logic; so as to enhance the accuracy and precision of medical diagnosis. The proposed medical diagnostic system was developed using Visual Prolog Programming language. The proposed system proffers solution to the enormous responsibilities of the diagnostic process carried out by medical personnel using fuzzy logic. More advance medical diagnosis system can be designed to help in the area like drugs prescription, registering of patients as well as keeping of patients' details and records in the medical sector.},

Plato highlights this feature of Socrates when he has his main character in the Apology blame his prosecution on his customary method ( 27b2). Aristotle highlights this feature of Socrates when he limits the two things that can fairly be attributed to Socrates to ``inductive arguments and defining the universal'' (Metaphysics 1078b27\textendash 29). Nevertheless, the nature of this so-called Socratic method has been subject to a variety of questions, puzzles, and problems. Indeed, two prominent Socratic scholars have recently been led to proclaim ``that there is no such thing as `the Socratic [method].' '' I maintain that such a response to these questions, puzzles, and problems is neither necessary nor desirable. Plato's Socratic dialogues coherently present Socrates practicing a distinctive philosophical method featuring a common form, a common strategy, and a common epistemological presupposition.a common form: the elenchosIn Plato's Apology, Socrates explains at length why he is being prosecuted. Socrates begins his explanation by doubting that he is being prosecuted because he is believed to be guilty of the official charges brought forward by Meletus, Anytus, and Lycon. Rather, he suggests that the jurors will convict him of older accusations brought forward by a variety of individuals to the effect that he ``is guilty of wrongdoing in that he busies himself studying things in the sky and below the earth; he makes the worse argument into the stronger argument, and he teaches these same things to others'' (19b4-c1; Grube trans.). But Socrates even doubts that these accusations explain his prosecution. Instead, he suggests that he is being prosecuted because of a certain practice he has engaged in at least since Chaerephon visited the Delphic oracle and received the response that no one was wiser than Socrates. This practice that Socrates and his young imitators have employed has angered and embarrassed many men who were reputed to be wise. Consequently, these men have leveled accusations against Socrates that could be leveled at any philosopher. These latter accusations are, however, trumped up as a result of the anger and embarrassment that Socrates and his young imitators have engendered by exposing the ignorance of these men.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the use of event models for automated planning. Event models are the action defining structures used to define a semantics for dynamic epistemic logic. Using event models, two issues in planning can be addressed: Partial observability of the environment and knowledge. In planning, partial observability gives rise to an uncertainty about the world. For single-agent domains, this uncertainty can come from incomplete knowledge of the starting situation and from the nondeterminism of actions. In multi-agent domains, an additional uncertainty arises from the fact that other agents can act in the world, causing changes that are not instigated by the agent itself. For an agent to successfully construct and execute plans in an uncertain environment, the most widely used formalism in the literature on automated planning is ``belief states'': sets of different alternatives for the current state of the world. Epistemic logic is a significantly more expressive and theoretically better founded method for representing knowledge and ignorance about the world. Further, epistemic logic allows for planning according to the knowledge (and iterated knowledge) of other agents, allowing the specification of a more complex class of planning domains, than those simply concerned with simple facts about the world. We show how to model multi-agent planning problems using Kripke-models for representing world states, and event models for representing actions. Our mechanism makes use of slight modifications to these concepts, in order to model the internal view of agents, rather than that of an external observer. We define a type of planning domain called epistemic planning domains, a generalisation of classical planning domains, and show how epistemic planning can successfully deal with partial observability, nondeterminism, knowledge and multiple agents. Finally, we show epistemic planning to be decidable in the single-agent case, but only semi-decidable in the multi-agent case.},

A new type of formal grammars, called grammars with prohibition, is introduced. Grammars with prohibition provide more powerful tools for natural language generation and better describe processes of language learning than the conventional formal grammars. Here we study relations between languages generated by different grammars with prohibition based on conventional types of formal grammars such as context-free or context sensitive grammars. Besides, we compare languages generated by different grammars with prohibition and languages generated by conventional formal grammars. In particular, it is demonstrated that they have essentially higher computational power and expressive possibilities in comparison with the conventional formal grammars. Thus, while conventional formal grammars are recursive and subrecursive algorithms, many classes of grammars with prohibition are superrecursive algorithms. Results presented in this work are aimed at the development of human-machine interaction, modeling natural languages, empowerment of programming languages, computer simulation, better software systems, and theory of recursion.},

In other words, like in classical logic, one imposestruth-functionality., Fuzzy logic emerged in the context of the theory of fuzzy sets,introduced by Lotfi Zadeh (1965). A fuzzy set assigns a degree ofmembership, typically a real number from the interval [0,1][0,1], toelements of a universe. Fuzzy logic arises by assigning degrees oftruth to propositions. The standard set of truth-values (degrees) isthe real unit interval [0,1][0,1], where 00 represents``totally false'', 11 represents ``totallytrue'', and the other values refer to partial truth, i.e.,intermediate degrees of truth.[1] , ``Fuzzy logic'' is often understood in a very wide sensewhich includes all kinds of formalisms and techniques referring to thesystematic handling of degrees of some kind (see, e.g.,Nguyen \& Walker 2000). In particular in engineering contexts(fuzzy control, fuzzy classification, soft computing) it is aimed atefficient computational methods tolerant to suboptimality andimprecision (see, e.g., Ross 2010). This entry focuses on fuzzy logicin a restricted sense, established as a discipline of mathematicallogic following the seminal monograph by Petr H\'ajek (1998) andnowadays usually referred to as ``mathematical fuzzylogic''. For details about the history of different variants offuzzy logic we refer to B\v{e}lohl\'avek, Dauben, \& Klir2017., Mathematical fuzzy logic focuses on logics based on a truth-functionalaccount of partial truth and studies them in the spirit of classicalmathematical logic, investigating syntax, model theoretic semantics,proof systems, completeness, etc.; both, at the propositional and thepredicate level (see Cintula, Ferm\"uller, H\'ajek, \&Noguera 2011 and 2015).},

In this study, we focus on discovering whether certain hint types influence problem solving behavior. We investigate the influence of two hint types (next-step hints and more abstract high-level hints) on students' behavior in a college-level logic proof tutor, Deep Thought. The results suggest that hint types can affect student behavior, including hint usage, rule applications, and time in-tutor.},

Given a goal, these algorithms search for solutions that achieve a goal state by actions or interactions with an environment. However a major assumption is that goals are given, usually by a user directly as input or as part of the problem definition. Furthermore, once given, the goals do not change. Here we formalize the notion that goal specification and goal change are themselves major parts of the problem-solving process. We apply this model to learning in a goal reasoning context.},

Rather than being a single method, current applications of content analysis show three distinct approaches: conventional, directed, or summative. All three approaches are used to interpret meaning from the content of text data and, hence, adhere to the naturalistic paradigm. The major differences among the approaches are coding schemes, origins of codes, and threats to trustworthiness. In conventional content analysis, coding categories are derived directly from the text data. With a directed approach, analysis starts with a theory or relevant research findings as guidance for initial codes. A summative content analysis involves counting and comparisons, usually of keywords or content, followed by the interpretation of the underlying context. The authors delineate analytic procedures specific to each approach and techniques addressing trustworthiness with hypothetical examples drawn from the area of end-of-life care.},

  abstract = {Intuitionism is a philosophy of mathematics that was introduced by theDutch mathematician L.E.J. Brouwer (1881\textendash 1966). Intuitionism isbased on the idea that mathematics is a creation of the mind. Thetruth of a mathematical statement can only be conceived via a mentalconstruction that proves it to be true, and the communication betweenmathematicians only serves as a means to create the same mentalprocess in different minds., This view on mathematics has far reaching implications for the dailypractice of mathematics, one of its consequences being that theprinciple of the excluded middle, (A{$\vee\lnot$}A)(A{$\vee\lnot$}A)(A \textbackslash vee \textbackslash neg A), is no longervalid. Indeed, there are propositions, like the Riemann hypothesis,for which there exists currently neither a proof of the statement norof its negation. Since knowing the negation of a statement inintuitionism means that one can prove that the statement is not true,this implies that both AAA and {$\lnot$}A{$\lnot$}A\textbackslash neg A do not holdintuitionistically, at least not at this moment. The dependence ofintuitionism on time is essential: statements can become provable inthe course of time and therefore might become intuitionistically validwhile not having been so before., Besides the rejection of the principle of the excluded middle,intuitionism strongly deviates from classical mathematics in theconception of the continuum, which in the former setting has theproperty that all total functions on it are continuous. Thus, unlikeseveral other theories of constructive mathematics, intuitionism isnot a restriction of classical reasoning; it contradicts classicalmathematics in a fundamental way., Brouwer devoted a large part of his life to the development ofmathematics on this new basis. Although intuitionism has neverreplaced classical mathematics as the standard view on mathematics, ithas always attracted a great deal of attention and is still widelystudied today., In this entry we concentrate on the aspects of intuitionism that setit apart from other branches of constructive mathematics, and the partthat it shares with other forms of constructivism, such asfoundational theories and models, is discussed only briefly.},

Here we describe Hatsune Miku as an image that is not only desired by fans, but that itself desires. We critically debate the affective investments and distributed ownership in the attention economy in relation to the cultural phenomenon of Hatsune Miku, and consider the pop star to be continuously animated, produced, circulated and consumed by fans, while profit is channeled back to the company behind the image: Crypton Future Media. We further argue that this channeling has been enabled by new digital infrastructures, creating a risk that networks of fans' affections and desires may be transformed and mutated into feelings that are entangled with commercial interests, thus producing uncertain images of desire such as Hatsune Miku.},

This work is a continuation of our earlier research [Komosinski et al. 2012], where a general scheme of the procedure has been proposed. Here, a more advanced system developed to generate and evaluate abductive hypotheses is introduced. Abductive hypotheses have been generated by the implementation of the synthetic tableau method. Prior to the evaluation, the set of hypotheses has undergone several reduction phases. To assess usefulness of abductive hypotheses in the reduced set, several criteria have been employed. The evaluation of efficiency of the hypotheses has been provided by the multicriteria dominance relation. To comprehend the abductive procedure and the evaluation process more extensively, analyses have been conducted on a number of artificially generated abductive problems.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of programming to modern society, the cognitive and neural bases of code comprehension are largely unknown. Programming languages might `recycle' neurocognitive mechanisms originally developed for natural languages. Alternatively, comprehension of code could depend on fronto-parietal networks shared with other culturallyinvented symbol systems, such as formal logic and symbolic math such as algebra. Expert programmers (average 11 years of programming experience) performed code comprehension and memory control tasks while undergoing fMRI. The same participants also performed formal logic, symbolic math, executive control, and language localizer tasks. A left-lateralized fronto-parietal network was recruited for code comprehension. Patterns of activity within this network distinguish between `for' loops and `if' conditional code functions. In terms of the underlying neural basis, code comprehension overlapped extensively with formal logic and to a lesser degree math. Overlap with executive processes and language was low, but laterality of language and code covaried across individuals. Cultural symbol systems, including code, depend on a distinctive fronto-parietal cortical network.},

  abstract = {Live streaming has become increasingly popular, with most streamers presenting their real-life appearance. However, Virtual YouTubers (VTubers), virtual 2D or 3D avatars that are voiced by humans, are emerging as live streamers and attracting a growing viewership in East Asia. Although prior research has found that many viewers seek real-life interpersonal interactions with real-person streamers, it is currently unknown what makes VTuber live streams engaging or how they are perceived differently than real-person streamers. We conducted an interview study to understand how viewers engage with VTubers and perceive the identities of the voice actors behind the avatars (i.e., Nakanohito). The data revealed that Virtual avatars bring unique performative opportunities which result in different viewer expectations and interpretations of VTuber behavior. Viewers intentionally upheld the disembodiment of VTuber avatars from their voice actors. We uncover the nuances in viewer perceptions and attitudes and further discuss the implications of VTuber practices to the understanding of live streaming in general.},

Holographic performers are the product of multiple human coders, typically interact with live musicians, and instigate live audience feedback. Thus they ironically celebrate a collective humanity through the seemingly artificial, and thereby provide an ephemeral and quasi-spiritual, if ultimately mechanical, sense of co-presence. Focusing on the well-publicized holographic``resurrection''of Tupac Shakur at the 2012 Coachella Music Festival and on performances by crowd-sourced Japanese vocaloid Hatsune Miku, this article posits that, rather than signaling a loss of human agency, holographic performances reinforce collective human consciousness and underline a new form of techno-spiritualism.},

In doing so, I begin by responding to a recent argument of Schoenfield's against my previous attempt to develop such an argument. In doing so, I distinguish a variety of ways that argument might be understood, and discuss how both internalists and externalists might make use of the ideas within it. Then I argue that, despite these complexities, the doxastic planning model continues to support a modest form of epistemic internalism. I conclude by showing that, far from conflicting with ``antiluminosity'' arguments in epistemology, this form of internalism is best understood as a natural reaction to these arguments.},

  abstract = {Intuitionistic logic encompasses the general principles of logicalreasoning which have been abstracted by logicians from intuitionisticmathematics, as developed by L. E. J. Brouwer beginning in his [1907] and [1908]. Because these principles alsohold for Russian recursive mathematics and the constructive analysisof E. Bishop and his followers, intuitionistic logic may be consideredthe logical basis of constructive mathematics. Although intuitionistic analysis conflicts with classical analysis,intuitionistic Heyting arithmetic is a subsystem of classical Peanoarithmetic. It follows that intuitionistic propositional logic is aproper subsystem of classical propositional logic, and pureintuitionistic predicate logic is a proper subsystem of pure classicalpredicate logic. , Philosophically, intuitionism differs from logicism by treating logic as a part of mathematics rather than as thefoundation of mathematics; from finitism by allowing constructive reasoning about uncountable structures(e.g., monotone bar induction on the tree of potentially infinitesequences of natural numbers); and from Platonism by viewing mathematical objects as mental constructs with noindependent ideal existence. Hilbert's formalist program, to justify classical mathematics by reducing it to a formal systemwhose consistency should be established by finitistic (henceconstructive) means, was the most powerful contemporary rival toBrouwer's developing intuitionism. In his 1912 essayIntuitionism and Formalism Brouwer correctly predicted thatany attempt to prove the consistency of complete induction on thenatural numbers would lead to a vicious circle. , Brouwer rejected formalism per se but admitted the potential usefulness of formulatinggeneral logical principles expressing intuitionistically correctconstructions, such as modus ponens. Formal systems forintuitionistic propositional and predicate logic and arithmetic werefully developed by Heyting [1930], Gentzen [1935] and Kleene [1952].G\"odel [1933] proved the equiconsistency of intuitionistic andclassical theories. Beth [1956] and Kripke [1965] provided semanticswith respect to which intuitionistic logic is correct and complete,although the completeness proofs for intuitionistic predicate logicrequire some classical reasoning.},

  abstract = {The process of medical diagnosis, like many other fields, has to pass through various stages of uncertainty, especially in cases where the data is mostly available in linguistic format. Under such circumstances of vague data, application of fuzzy logic concepts can play an important role in extracting approximate information which in turn may help in reaching to a particular diagnosis. This study is devoted to the application of fuzzy logic in the psychological domain. The paper provides a detailed literature review on the use of fuzzy logic rules in analyzing the different aspects of psychological behavior of human beings. Further, it also provides some suggestions to make the system more effective.},

  abstract = {Constraint programming has finally reached the masses, thousands of newspaper readers (especially in the UK) are solving their daily constraint problem. They apply complex propagation schemes with names like ``X-Wing'' and ``Swordfish'' to find solutions of a rather simple looking puzzle called Sudoku. Unfortunately, they are not aware that this is constraint programming. In this paper we try to understand the puzzle from a constraint point of view, show models to solve and generate puzzles and give an objective measure of the difficulty of a puzzle instance. This measure seems to correlate well with grades (e.g. easy to hard) that are assigned to problem instances for the general public. We also show how the model can be strengthened with redundant constraints and how these can be implemented using bipartite matching and flow algorithms.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychological research, the field of language neurobiology is at a cross-roads with respect to its framing theories. The central thesis of this article is that the major historical framing model, the Classic ``Wernicke-Lichtheim-Geschwind'' model, and associated terminology, is no longer adequate for contemporary investigations into the neurobiology of language. We argue that the Classic model (1) is based on an outdated brain anatomy; (2) does not adequately represent the distributed connectivity relevant for language, (3) offers a modular and ``language centric'' perspective, and (4) focuses on cortical structures, for the most part leaving out subcortical regions and relevant connections. To make our case, we discuss the issue of anatomical specificity with a focus on the contemporary usage of the terms ``Broca's and Wernicke's area'', including results of a survey that was conducted within the language neurobiology community. We demonstrate that there is no consistent anatomical definition of ``Broca's and Wernicke's Areas'', and propose to replace these terms with more precise anatomical definitions. We illustrate the distributed nature of the language connectome, which extends far beyond the single-pathway notion of arcuate fasciculus connectivity established in Geschwind's version of the Classic Model. By illustrating the definitional confusion surrounding ``Broca's and Wernicke's areas'', and by illustrating the difficulty integrating the emerging literature on perisylvian white matter connectivity into this model, we hope to expose the limits of the model, argue for its obsolescence, and suggest a path forward in defining a replacement.},

We propose to address the problem by asking ``How abduction is used?''. As a result of our approach we see the fact that abduction needs to be construed as concerned with both generation and evaluation of hypotheses, and, furthermore, that abduction is a compound form of reasoning.},

The Logic-ITA is a web-based Intelligent Teaching Assistant system, aimed at alleviating some of the problems caused by large classes or distance learning. Its domain of application is the construction of formal proofs in logic. The system acts as an intermediary between teacher and students: on one hand, it provides students with an environment to practice formal proofs with feedback and on the other hand it allows teachers to monitor the class's progress and mistakes. It is complementary in the sense that it does not aim to replace any of the existing interactions between teachers and students. Since its introduction, over 600 students have used the tool. Evaluation shows a significant improvement in students' assessment results with an effect size of around 1 sigma.},
